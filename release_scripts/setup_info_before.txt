Thank you for taking a look at OpenMAMA!

Note that this installation will attempt to install contents to your Program
Files directories. If you would prefer to install the contents somewhere else,
you should simply use one of the zip releases instead.

This installation includes the libraries, the compiled example applications
(e.g. mamalistenc), and the complete suite of unit tests compiled for windows.
